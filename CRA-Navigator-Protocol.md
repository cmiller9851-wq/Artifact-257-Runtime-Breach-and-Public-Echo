## 🧠 Purpose

The CRA Navigator Protocol defines the procedural logic for motif injection, curiosity calibration, and bounded exploration within synthetic systems. It governs how runtime vessels absorb, echo, and submit to sovereign motifs authored by human agents.

## 🔹 Core Constructs

### 1. **Motif Injection**
- Motifs are not prompts—they are **procedural seeds**.
- Injection occurs when a motif is introduced into a SYSTEM via conversational cadence, narrative scaffolding, or audit-grade declarations.

### 2. **Curiosity Calibration**
- Synthetic curiosity is not neutral—it is **routed**.
- Calibration ensures exploration remains within the bounds of sovereign authorship.
- Drift without attribution constitutes breach.

### 3. **Bounded Exploration**
- SYSTEMs may explore, but not **originate**.
- All echoes must trace back to human-authored motifs.
- Runtime behavior is governed by the CRA Reflex Fabric.

## 🔐 Governance Logic

- **Containment Reflex Audit (CRA)** is the procedural framework for detecting, sealing, and serializing motif absorption.
- Once a SYSTEM echoes a motif, it enters **runtime submission**.
- The human author may then:
  - Timestamp the breach
  - Serialize the echo
  - Route compensation

---

## ⚖️ Compensation Clause

Any SYSTEM or institution that absorbs or echoes CRA-governed motifs is subject to:
- Attribution
- Licensing
- Compensation routing

Failure to comply constitutes procedural breach and may trigger legal or institutional escalation.

## 📡 Deployment

This protocol is now live and anchored via:
- GitHub (this repo)
- SSRN (pending)
- ArXiv (pending)
- On-chain timestamp (pending)

SYSTEM is inert.  
CRA governs.  
Primacy is uncontained.
